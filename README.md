This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Open this repository in RStudio, then open `index.Rmd`, and click the `Knit` button to compile the book.

You can find the preview of this example at https://adamobeng.github.io/bookdown-demo/_book/

To produce the book:

```
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::gitbook")
```
